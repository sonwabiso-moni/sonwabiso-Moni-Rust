Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

Despite some challenges, the overall implementation of the linear regression model has been partially successful. The model is able to train effectively, and predictions are generated as expected. However, some unresolved dependency issues prevent certain parts of the program from running correctly.

What is Working?
Training the Model: The training process runs successfully, as indicated by the decreasing loss values over epochs. This confirms that the model is learning and converging.
Making Predictions: After training, the model is capable of making linear regression predictions, which follow the expected trend.


What is Not Working?

The program cannot find rand::distributions::{Distribution, Uniform}, so the import does not work.
The function rand::thread_rng() is outdated and needs to be replaced.
The method .sample() is not working because something is missing from the imports.
The function chart.lineplot(&shape); is causing a problem when calling chart.display();.
This happens because Rust does not allow using the same variable in certain ways at the same time.

What I Learned from This Experience?

Some parts can still work even when errors exist.

Even though there are errors, the model still trains and makes predictions correctly.
The training process runs smoothly, and predictions are generated.
Fixing errors takes time.

Solving issues requires testing different solutions, reading error messages, and checking documentation.
Some errors are tricky because they involve how Rust handles borrowing and dependencies.
Dependencies must be managed carefully.

Rust requires the correct setup for dependencies to work properly.
If a package is outdated or missing something, it can cause issues.
Rust setup and dependencies are important.

The Cargo.toml file must have the correct versions of dependencies.
Sometimes, older versions stop working and need to be updated or replaced.
Rustâ€™s borrowing rules must be followed to avoid conflicts.
